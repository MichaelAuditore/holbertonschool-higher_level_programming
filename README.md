# Python High level language

This repo will contain all exercises and programs will be doing by the time.

Python Language will use the PEP 8 style version 1.7 or superior

# Conclusion

	At step 1 all the files must be executable and it's First line will be a Shebang like #!/usr/bin/python3
	and it will be tested by wc command to know the length of the files

	At step 2 we solve problems using statements and different kind of loops, variables and arithmetic and logical operators

	At step 3 we solve problems importing and modulin' our .py files to execute after, also we import sys to work with
	line arguments.

	At step 4 we solve problems using lists and tuples
